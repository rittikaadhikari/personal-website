                        <p>i feel like nothing is important anymore. i feel dead. the numbers imprinted in my skin taunt me; they whisper, "he's
                            not the one." i glare at them until i feel tears creeping into my eyes because i know that the clock is right. that
                            goddamned clock, a surgically implanted part of me ever since i was five, has gained control over my love life, my
                            free will. i want to cut out the numbers, and convince myself that it isn't true, but it&rsquo;s useless. the blue
                            officers would wipe my memories if i ever kissed him. the Higher Power claims to always make the right choice for
                            the country, and for us. too many wars have been fought in the name of love. why not just stanch the variable? a
                            gush of cool air shimmers in with the silvery moonlight, and i shiver involuntarily. i suppose they&rsquo;re right;
                            he&rsquo;s not my compatible match. i just don&rsquo;t want to admit it to myself. because if he's not the one, then
                            why does it hurt so much?&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>why does he have to be my best friend, my second half, except... he's just thwarted by a meaningless Soulmate&copy;.
                            a useless Soulmate<em>&copy;</em>. his dark brown eyes haunt my dreams, and i can almost feel him near me&hellip;
                            next to me, sitting in the park, under the faint moonlight. his obliviousness to the world is almost adorable, and
                            when he&rsquo;s confused, he scrunches up his eyebrows and stares at the offending object. (usually it&rsquo;s me.
                            he never knows what to make of me, even though we&rsquo;ve been friends forever. i think it&rsquo;s because we keep
                            on alternating from bickering like frenemies, and flirting like lovers.) he looks at everything with such childish
                            wonder and i feel the urge to protect him from the world. but i can&rsquo;t save him from fate.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;a familiar rapping on the window interrupts my musing. i eagerly open the window, and i want to touch the
                            little dimple in his cheek from the involuntary smile tracing his lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;ll finally meet her today,&rdquo; he murmurs, slumping on the ugly tweed couch. he looks a little
                            shocked, a little in disbelief.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;i know.&rdquo; i reach out and squeeze his hand in assurance. even though i&rsquo;m losing him, i&rsquo;m not
                            going to let my best friend go through this alone.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;i&hellip; i&rsquo;ve been waiting for her all my life. i&hellip; i&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; he whispers. he
                            looks like a lost puppy, his lower lip curling into a pout.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; i want to tell him that i love him. but i&hellip; i can&rsquo;t. i can&rsquo;t
                            let him lose everything he cares about. we sit in silence, our fingers interlaced in imperfect harmony, and the only
                            thing that matters is that we have each other.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after a
                            few minutes, he awkwardly clears his throat. &ldquo;i, uh, i have to go to work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;cool.&rdquo;
                            i give him this highly spasmodic salute, and internally berate myself as he crawls out the bay window.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;as i lower my left hand, my longing gaze falls upon the blasphemous timer. i glare at the imprinted numbers. if
                            i carved out my Soulmate&copy; timer, i would die. but isn&rsquo;t being forced to marry, to have it all decided
                            <em>for</em> you, a fate worse than death? i mean, i understand that they want everyone to be happy, to find that
                            person that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;meant to be with&rdquo;&hellip; but i have no independence. i&rsquo;m controlled
                            every step of the way.</p>
                        <p>i can never be with the one i love because of the Higher Power. the worst part is, i know he&rsquo;s been looking
                            forward to meeting his Soulmate&copy;. he might be scared, but he holds a beautiful romanticized perception of
                            Soulmate&copy; love. why should i take that from him with my selfish declarations of love? no, there&rsquo;s no use
                            in telling him. i know that i&rsquo;m the only one that&rsquo;ll get hurt. besides, his timer goes off at 8:45 <span
                                style="text-decoration: underline;">today</span>, and he will forget all about me. i look at the protruding
                            pulsating foreign object in my wrist. the numbers, 00:00:00:24:15:00 are blinking on my wrist, in standard digitime
                            font. my timer goes off <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tomorrow</span> at 8:45. just one day apart.</p>
                        <p>but now it&rsquo;s 8:30. i fight the urge to run over to him, proclaim my love, kiss him, <em>anything</em>. but i
                            don&rsquo;t want to ruin his life. i love him enough to let him go. i take a walk down the block, and i find myself
                            staring into the window of the coffee shop. i see the most beautiful girl walk by, with curly-ish black hair, and
                            tanned skin. so much prettier than me. i immediately know that this is the girl for him. i don&rsquo;t know what i
                            was expecting. i guess i wasn&rsquo;t meant to be with someone as beautiful as him&hellip; i watch it all happen.
                            the clock strikes 8:45 and he looks out the window, from behind the counter. we lock eyes, dark brown meeting light
                            blue. traces of the moon&rsquo;s reflection flicker on the glass window. i look at my timer fervently, hoping that
                            something in my timer changed. but&hellip; nothing. i am met with a countdown of 24 hours. i look down forlornly,
                            tears filling my eyes, as he notices the beautiful petite girl standing in front of him.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>i start running as fast as i can, because i don&rsquo;t want to be near their budding romance. it makes me want to
                            throw up. i run to the park and sit by our tree. i cry as i remember our little picnics, when he used to push me on
                            the swing when we were younger, when we gazed at the stars, never wondering about our future. we always sang
                            together, and when i sang, it was always about him. i don&rsquo;t sing anymore because it hurts too much to think
                            about our impending fate with different people. i stopped last year, when i realized i was in love with him. he sang
                            for at least a month longer, until he realized he felt soundless and incomplete without me. i feel as speechless as
                            he does.</p>
                        <p>and everyone says that this &ldquo;love&rdquo; is inconsequential, because i&rsquo;m sixteen and i&rsquo;m hormonal;
                            i don&rsquo;t know what love is.they all tell me that everyone latches onto someone other than their Soulmate&copy;
                            at some point of time, but this is to be ignored. in fact, according to them, it&rsquo;s just my fear of meeting the
                            love of my life projected on this person. but they&rsquo;re wrong. loving someone is&hellip; it&rsquo;s giving him
                            the power to destroy you, while trusting that he won&rsquo;t. and the worst part is, i bet he doesn&rsquo;t even
                            know, and he&rsquo;s obliviously breaking my heart. oh god, it kills me inside, but i want him to be happy. i cry
                            because i&rsquo;m hopelessly in love. sobs are choking me.</p>
                        <p>i see him walking over with&hellip; wait. he&rsquo;s alone. why is he alone? they&rsquo;re supposed to get
                            <em>married</em> in three months, and he abandoned her? he sits next to me and holds my hand.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;i wished it was you,&rdquo; he says leaning his head on my shoulder. &ldquo;i always wanted it to be you.
                            today, reality came crashing down on me&hellip;&rdquo; his tears dampen my shirt. &ldquo;i can&rsquo;t lose
                            you.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; i whisper, lifting his head off my shoulder. &ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry i ruined you. i
                            never thought i&rsquo;d love you, or anyone really. you&rsquo;re my best friend. but i guess love comes when you
                            least expect it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>he looks down for a brief moment. &ldquo;i&hellip; i feel the same way. i know all of your flaws, but somehow this
                            makes me love you more.&rdquo; he starts leaning towards me.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>we kiss. it&rsquo;s illegal, and there&rsquo;s some of a thrill. i can feel my Soulmate&copy; clock buzzing angrily,
                            screaming &ldquo;no&hellip; you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; it&rsquo;s sending me a warning, telling me that we could get
                            punished, if we didn&rsquo;t stop now. i don&rsquo;t care. i hold on to his left wrist, and i can feel his clock
                            pulsing, infuriated with its owner. the sweet taste of freedom lingers in my mouth. there are explosions in my
                            heart. i feel, like i&rsquo;ve lost gravity. is it normal to be so desperate, so eager to touch, to hold one another
                            close? i can&rsquo;t get enough of his lips. this must be love. i never want to stop. his hands are bunching up my
                            short auburn hair, and i&rsquo;m tempted to yell at him to stop messing up my hair, but if i did that, we&rsquo;d
                            have to stop. but i wanted to have as much of this while i still could. because in nine months, he&rsquo;d have to
                            have children with his Soulmate&copy;, something i could never do.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;dammit, i love you so much,&rdquo; he sobs, his forehead delicately pressed against mine.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t ever be together,&rdquo; i whisper. &ldquo;as much as i love you, the Higher Power&hellip;
                            they&rsquo;ve already decided our fates,&rdquo; i choke out. &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t want you to miss your chance with
                            her. i don&rsquo;t want the Higher Power to kill us for not obeying our timers. you have to marry her for a reason.
                            she is your match made in heaven,&rdquo; i murmur.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;then we&rsquo;re a match made in hell. i&rsquo;m okay with that,&rdquo; he insists.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>he leans in to kiss me again, but i stop him this time. &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t. these Soulmate&copy; timers dictate
                            who we marry, when we marry, when we have children&hellip; the Higher Power forbids us. we&rsquo;ll die if we rip
                            these out. and all i ever wanted was for you to be happy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>he looks at me, teary eyed. &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we pull a romeo &amp; juliet?&rdquo; he asks, his eyes sparkling with
                            a vivacity i&rsquo;ve rarely seen in anyone.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;we&rsquo;d die,&rdquo; i chuckle. a smile of remembrance traces my lips. the first time we met&hellip; back in
                            sixth grade, when we found each other behind the forbidden fence, his red-brimmed glasses slightly askew, my eyes
                            shining with wonder as i thumbed through the worn pages of everything pertaining to love. romeo &amp; juliet was our
                            favorite, even though we never could find the end, underneath the rubble.</p>
                        <p>everything hurts. i get up from the bench. &ldquo;good-by.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>he turns around and whispers in a voice barely audible, &ldquo;good-by, love.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>i walk back to my apartment. in the middle of the night, when all is calm, i hear loud knocks on the door. the Higher
                            Power officials&hellip; the timers&hellip; i open my bay window, and stare at the faint moonlight. the moon is
                            barely peeking out with its white luminescence, from under the pitch black skies. the moon is too brilliant to be
                            fully overshadowed by the murky skies. i will not let the government wipe my memories because i love him. i&rsquo;m
                            sick of being controlled, like i&rsquo;m a doll. they already took away my independence. they dictated my love life.
                            he&rsquo;s probably already been brainwashed by now. at least he&rsquo;ll be happy, with his Soulmate&copy;&hellip;
                            but i&rsquo;m scared. i&rsquo;m not ready to lose everything i&rsquo;ve ever known. i want to live. but i
                            don&rsquo;t want to be their puppet anymore. i hear a loud bang and men in navy blue suits walk in. i take one
                            glance at the moon, so tentative, so scared of the darkness. they&rsquo;re pointing their laser stun guns at me. no.
                            i love this outfit. they&rsquo;re not gonna burn a fucking hole in it, like they did to everything else in my life.
                            i jump, and i&rsquo;m free-falling three stories down. the gravity of my decision weighs on me as fast as the blood
                            in my body rushes to my brain. i&rsquo;m finally free.</p>
