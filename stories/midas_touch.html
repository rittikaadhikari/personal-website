                        <p>The blinds are closed, as they always are. We can&rsquo;t risk a tell-all flash sneaking in between.</p>
                        <p>Like you always say, where there is light, a burst of flashes follows with a sputter of clicks. And wherever you are,
                            there is light.</p>
                        <p>But it&rsquo;s dark whenever you&rsquo;re gone. We leave the lights dimmed when I&rsquo;m here, and whenever I want
                            to leave, I must sneak out before dawn. You tell me that I&rsquo;m your best-kept secret, hidden away by lock and
                            key. You say that secrets are better, that we&rsquo;re hidden to be protected, and you wouldn&rsquo;t protect
                            something useless.</p>
                        <p>That must mean I&rsquo;m <em>something</em>.</p>
                        <p>But, without you, I feel like nothing. You make me golden.</p>
                        <p>I hear our secret knock on the door; it&rsquo;s my cue to let you in.</p>
                        <p>I peer through the peephole and recognize your light hazel eyes. My heart leaps as the door creaks and your skirt
                            swishes as you embrace me. You smell like peaches, sweat, and&hellip; aftershave.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel disappointed.</p>
                        <p>You tilt my chin up with your perfectly manicured fingers.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re the only one I love,&rdquo; you murmur in that soft voice.</p>
                        <p>I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re so smooth, but my heart flutters as you gently kiss my cheek, your long blonde
                            ringlets brushing against my shoulder. You&rsquo;re intoxicating enough for me to push away that lingering scent.
                        </p>
                        <p>I close the door, and watch as you throw your scarf on the recliner, plop onto the leather couch, and prop your feet
                            up on our mahogany coffee table. I sit next to you, nestling my head in the crook of your neck. Your hand finds its
                            way into mine and our fingers intertwine as the TV hums contentedly in the background.</p>
                        <p>We sit in silence, your thumb gently rubbing my hand in circles. I don&rsquo;t want to ask you what you did today,
                            because that&rsquo;ll just ruin our carefully crafted picture of bliss. Your eyes are fixated on the TV, watching a
                            rerun of one of your episodes. You like to take mental notes, to try and do better next time. My heart pangs as I
                            see his hand tangled in your long golden hair, his arm loosely resting on your waist, as you both are wrapped up in
                            a masquerade of passion, an acceptable heat. You squeeze my hand as if to tell me not to worry.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>As the show comes to an end, you lean forward and turn the TV off with a satisfying click. You rest your arm on the
                            couch and turn to look at me, smiling with your dimple, an exclamation point to certify that your happiness is not a
                            farce.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I missed you, Luce.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>You gently push a fallen strand of hair out of my face, grazing my cheek.</p>
                        <p>I don&rsquo;t want to bring up how you haven&rsquo;t come home for the past four days, or how you took <em>hours</em>
                            to ever respond to any of my messages on your stupid burner phone. It&rsquo;s been too long since I&rsquo;ve seen
                            you, and kissing you seems like a better use of my time than fighting about things we can&rsquo;t change.</p>
                        <p>And so, I melt in you, and let you infect me with your Midas touch. My hands tangle in your hair, my lips ask yours
                            the questions I don&rsquo;t want to speak aloud, your leg brushes against mine and&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It all reminds me too much of your ingenuine kiss with him.</p>
                        <p>I pull away, flushed. It bothers me that your lips are not mine, that someone else has tasted your strawberry lip
                            gloss and might have even kissed that part of your shoulder that&rsquo;s exposed when you&rsquo;re wearing your
                            oversized gray hoodie. I hate that our heat is now disallowed, that kissing me is worse for business and that your
                            relationship for pretend boosts your ratings.</p>
                        <p>You look up at me with your doe-like eyes, your hand on my shoulder slipping down to gently press against my thigh,
                            the leather creaking as you shift away from me.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I force a smile. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p><em>I hate it when you pretend like you don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s no need to act at home.</em></p>
                        <p>You&rsquo;re making that face again, that face where you tell me not to &ldquo;throw a fit.&rdquo; As if it&rsquo;s
                            abnormal for your girlfriend of four years to feel just a <em>little</em> jealous that you&rsquo;re fake-dating
                            that&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Is this about Steve?&rdquo; you ask, rolling your eyes.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I turn away, my face burning with embarrassment. I loathe how you make all of my concerns seem so trivial.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re adorable when you&rsquo;re angry.&rdquo; You wrap your arms around my shoulders and press your
                            lips against my temple.</p>
                        <p>I lean back into your embrace. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve felt this, and even if I&rsquo;m upset, who
                            knows how long I&rsquo;ll get you for this time. It&rsquo;s probably only a matter of days before you have to go
                            back on set.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I hate this.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>You let out a long sigh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how it is, Lucy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I despise that answer. You make me feel like I&rsquo;m a child, like it&rsquo;s beyond me to understand why
                            we&rsquo;re secret.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;How long do I have to wait?&rdquo; I mumble, inhaling your sweet scent.</p>
                        <p>You run your hands tenderly through my hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there, Lucy. My manager told me I could be the
                            next Jennifer Aniston if I play all of my cards right. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried, I just&hellip; how long do you have to date&hellip;&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t even bring
                            myself to say his name.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><em>How can you say his name so nonchalantly?</em></p>
                        <p>I nod, burrowing my face further into the crook of your neck.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just for publicity, Luce. I don&rsquo;t get why you&rsquo;re so worried. I obviously don&rsquo;t
                            like him.&rdquo; You brush a fallen strand of hair behind my ear.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like him, but-&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>You move your right arm off of my shoulder, gripping the couch cushion instead. &ldquo;If you know that, then why is
                            there a problem?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Because, even if it&rsquo;s all fake, and even if you don&rsquo;t love him, it just feels so real. On our 40 inch LCD
                            TV, you both just look right together. Critics praise your chemistry, tabloids are splattered with pictures of the
                            two of you on your &ldquo;dates,&rdquo; and your subreddit is flooded with comments of &ldquo;will-they,
                            won&rsquo;t-they.&rdquo; But if I tell you all of this, I know you&rsquo;ll just laugh. You&rsquo;ll say,
                            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all for show,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My manager wants to make sure the show gets more attention,&rdquo;
                            or &ldquo;You know how the public gets. Don&rsquo;t read into it,&rdquo; or some other excuse to brush me off.</p>
                        <p>I take a deep breath.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;When can we be public?&rdquo; My hands are trembling and I&rsquo;m sure you can feel my heartbeat quicken
                            through my back.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You lean forward to kiss my neck. A slight shiver falls over me. It&rsquo;s unfair that you hold this ungrateful
                            power over me.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Just a few more months, Lucy,&rdquo; you whisper in between your soft kisses. My skin is so warm, it feels
                            like it&rsquo;s burning as you leave your tattoo kisses, a declaration that I am yours and yours only. I wish I
                            could do the same, leave an imprint of my love on you, one that you&rsquo;d try to hide with your scarf like a
                            poorly kept secret.</p>
                        <p>But for now, I let you consume me in your love.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m sprawled on my twin-sized bed, scrolling through Instagram. I <em>should</em> be studying for my
                            programming exam tomorrow, but my roommate just left for an interview, and who knows when we&rsquo;ll get another
                            chance.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I hear our secret knock on the dorm room door - three successive raps, followed by a counterclockwise turn of the
                            door handle. I rush to open the door, flushed with excitement.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; you say, smiling brighter than I could imagine. You&rsquo;re blushing so much, to the point that
                            your face matches your bright pink hair.</p>
                        <p>I leap to hug you, and I&rsquo;m flooded with the smell of peaches. I hope you never change your shampoo.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty,&rdquo; I mumble as <em>Hamilton </em>faintly hums from the airpod in your left ear.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;No you.&rdquo; You burrow your head further into the crook of my neck.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I pull away from you. I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ve done it, but you somehow look prettier than you did during
                            Senior Year prom in your simple fit-and-flare black dress. Maybe it&rsquo;s because this time I actually get to hold
                            your hand, instead of admiring you from afar.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; so are we going to&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m burning red as I fumble to ask <em>the </em>question.
                        </p>
                        <p>You look away as you bite your lip, and nervously nod.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I hold your hand, and I&rsquo;m suddenly conscious of how clammy my hand must be, and how obnoxious that zit on my
                            nose is. But, I try to let go of my inhibitions, close my eyes, and lean in until our lips meet.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Your lips are soft and warm, but unlike every other time, there&rsquo;s an underlying heat behind our kiss. You move
                            your hands to grasp at my short brown hair, as I move mine onto your hips, your light gray beanie slipping off of
                            your hair as we stumble onto my bed.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Your skin is burning hot as I pepper your neck with kisses until I&rsquo;ve marked my claim. I want you to walk out
                            of here with one of my infinity scarves wrapped around your neck. I want to see you flush with embarrassment when
                            one of our friends inevitably tease us for our moment of passion. I want this to be a reminder of our love, an
                            imprint that you can&rsquo;t so easily erase.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>You told me you&rsquo;d be here at 6 PM sharp. You said it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many retakes the director wants,
                            you would make <em>sure </em>you left early. If your manager asked, you&rsquo;d tell him it was urgent. If Steve
                            wanted to go on another publicity &ldquo;date,&rdquo; you&rsquo;d tell him you&rsquo;re busy. You <em>promised</em>
                            me you&rsquo;d be here.</p>
                        <p>But it&rsquo;s 7:45 PM, the sun is setting, and I still haven&rsquo;t seen your face.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Why am I not surprised?</p>
                        <p>My strawberry shortcake looks sad and lonely on the mahogany kitchen table, lying there unpresumptuously, leaning
                            ever so slightly to the right. The smell of smoke from 24 stubs of candles is long gone, wafted away by the draft
                            from the window I left slightly open. We&rsquo;re almost out of pepperoni pizza - Max and the other boys from our
                            college theater troupe almost single-handedly demolished that.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Mia plops down on the couch next to me. &ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; she asks, and I hate the look of pity on her
                            face.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I force a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine! Microsoft&rsquo;s been keeping me busy lately, so I&rsquo;m just a little too
                            wiped out for a party.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>She raises an eyebrow and immediately calls my bluff. &ldquo;Look, how have things been since Ava became
                            famous?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>I swallow back some tears. You should have been here. Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have to look so stupid in front of all of
                            our friends, like some pathetic freak that follows you around.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; peachy,&rdquo; I smile back.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Mia sighs loudly. &ldquo;Lucy, I know you better than that. We&rsquo;ve been friends for six years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I stand up and head to the bathroom. I don&rsquo;t think I can hold back my tears anymore. Everyone stares as Mia
                            runs after me, trying to console me.</p>
                        <p>The loud chatter of the party fades, and all I can hear is this deafening silence because you said you&rsquo;d be
                            here, but you&rsquo;re not, and our relationship feels like nothing but a farce.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I slump onto the toilet, letting my tears fall into my hands.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Mia walks in with a fuschia balloon in her hand.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Pop it,&rdquo; she says, handing me the balloon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I squeeze the balloon with all my force as it bursts with a booming pop. I wish I could say all my problems are
                            solved, but all I feel is overwhelming disappointment.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I hate how I believe your lies. You&rsquo;re like a siren; every word you speak is a lie, a way to draw me in closer,
                            and every time I believe your deception, I fall deeper and deeper into your Tartarus, trapping me in darkness.
                            Whenever you decide I&rsquo;ve fallen enough, that my misery is suitable, you grace me with your light and make me
                            golden so I forget.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Now tell me, what&rsquo;s <em>actually</em> wrong?&rdquo; Mia asks, kneeling down to be at my level.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I sigh. &ldquo;Ever since Ava became famous, I feel like an afterthought. She&rsquo;s hyperfocused on her career
                            and&hellip; definitely crosses some lines in our relationship to get where she wants to be.&rdquo; I bury my face in
                            my hands.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Talk with her. You weren&rsquo;t like this before, back when we were in college. You two were
                            inseparable,&rdquo; she says, placing a comforting hand on my knee.</p>
                        <p>She&rsquo;s right. Once upon a time, before Steve, before your manager, before you were the star that you are, we
                            were happy. <em>I</em> was happy. I miss that dorky theater kid with the bright pink hair and gray beanie who
                            obsessed over Hamilton. I miss how we used to watch reruns of Glee at 2 AM, how you&rsquo;d cover me with a blanket
                            whenever I&rsquo;d doze off, how you&rsquo;d randomly blurt out that I&rsquo;m beautiful even when I was in sweats.
                            I miss when we could go to cafes and restaurants together without paparazzi jumping out of nowhere asking what we
                            were. We used to have a quiet, unspoken intimacy, our love exchanged through furtive glances, walking with our
                            pinkies intertwined, and whispers of secrets.</p>
                        <p>Now, I barely ever see you, and whenever I do, it&rsquo;s all physical. None of that muted love, just kisses to light
                            me on fire, to make me your plaything.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;She never tells me I&rsquo;m beautiful,&rdquo; I mumble absentmindedly.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Mia looks at me, concerned. &ldquo;She still loves you,&rdquo; she says, but it sounds like a lie.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but lie to myself too.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>At 9:30, I finally hear our secret knock. I swear I heard you hesitate, but god knows you never do that around
                            me.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I hate how my heart skips a beat. Only you make me act this stupid.</p>
                        <p>I reluctantly trudge to the door and let you in.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You embrace me, pulling me close enough that I can smell the peach shampoo you use. &ldquo;Happy Birthday
                            Lucy,&rdquo; you mumble.</p>
                        <p>You pull away to admire the massacre that happened when you were gone.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; it looks like you had fun here.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re still smiling with that stupid dimple.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call it &lsquo;fun&rsquo;.&rdquo; Pizza boxes are strewn waywardly, dirty plates
                            piled in the sink, with the exception of two, and a very sad strawberry shortcake sits as a centerpiece on our
                            kitchen table. The top layer of the shortcake has almost completely slid off onto the table.</p>
                        <p>You take a deep breath and look down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m so late.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;My party is over. I think you&rsquo;re a little beyond &lsquo;late&rsquo;, Ava.&rdquo; My knees are going
                            weak. I lean on the doorframe for support, my heart pounding so loudly I can hear the blood pumping in my
                            ears.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I should have been here.&rdquo; You walk towards me.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You promised,&rdquo; I say, my voice cracking as I choke back a sob.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I know, but I had to stay on for work. The director wanted retakes of this one scene with Steve, and they
                            wouldn&rsquo;t let me leave filming early. They said if we didn&rsquo;t finish this scene, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able
                            to release the season on time, and I just <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> leave,&rdquo; you ramble, explaining with your
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>I don&rsquo;t even know what to say, so I just stare back at you, my heart breaking. I&rsquo;m the afterthought
                            here.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s cut some cake!&rdquo; You walk over to the kitchen table, your skirt swishing as you try
                            to brush away my sadness.</p>
                        <p><em>Why are you not on your hands and knees, apologizing for being late, begging for my forgiveness? How could you so
                                carelessly break a promise?</em></p>
                        <p>I clear my throat, trying to hold back the tears as you attempt to push the top layer of my cake back on.
                            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my <em>birthday</em>, Ava. Why can&rsquo;t I be the most important person today, and not your
                            work?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Luce, like I said, I couldn&rsquo;t get out of filming. You know I wanted to be here,&rdquo; you say, your
                            voice about to break.</p>
                        <p>Tears start streaming down my face. &ldquo;What happened to us?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Nothing happened, I still love you the same,&rdquo; you say in desperation.</p>
                        <p>I shake my head. &ldquo;No. You love your career more than me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Please, c&rsquo;mere Luce,&rdquo; you cry, arms extended.</p>
                        <p>I hate how I accept your embrace.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You run a hand through my hair. &ldquo;I know things have been&hellip; harder since I became famous. Just&hellip;
                            give me some time, okay? I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t been here.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>I sigh and squeeze you a little tighter.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I love you Ava. But I don&rsquo;t know how much more I can take,&rdquo; I mumble, nuzzling my head into your
                            hair.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Just wait for this season to end. I promise, you&rsquo;ll be my priority. Not my career, my manager, or
                            Steve.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>You pull away and smile at me. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have the birthday girl crying, now can we?&rdquo; You gently rub
                            away the tears with your thumb.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go celebrate my favorite person,&rdquo; you say with that money-making smile of
                            yours. I never told you this, but I miss how your teeth were just slightly crooked. It made you unique, different.
                        </p>
                        <p>You grab my hand, walking me over to our imperfectly perfect cake. Sure, it&rsquo;s a little slanted, but you fixed
                            it, just like you always do.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>The last I heard from you, you told me you would be &lsquo;busy,&rsquo; so you wouldn&rsquo;t be coming around for a
                            while. With the new season wrapping up, you needed to spend more time filming.</p>
                        <p>But it&rsquo;s been two weeks since I&rsquo;ve heard from you.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s lonely in this house, so I&rsquo;ve been inviting Mia over after work to keep me company. I&rsquo;ve been
                            working longer hours and I started playing the piano again, to try and keep my mind off of you.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Nothing seems to work though. You&rsquo;re etched into my brain like a pretty picture, and I can&rsquo;t seem to let
                            you go.</p>
                        <p>Out of nowhere, I hear a ding on my phone. I pick it up, hoping that you&rsquo;ve finally responded to me. But,
                            it&rsquo;s just a notification from one of the tabloids I subscribe to. It&rsquo;s probably just some gossip about
                            some celebrity&rsquo;s new beau, or whatever. I swipe down to see the headline, since I&rsquo;ve got nothing better
                            to do, and&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Sizzling: Ava Adams &amp; Steve Goldsmith Can&rsquo;t Keep Their Hands Off Each Other on Steamy Beach Getaway</p>
                        <p>I&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>What?&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This can&rsquo;t be real.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In disbelief, I click on the article and it&rsquo;s plastered with pictures of you and <em>Steve</em> in the Pacific,
                            your hands tangled in his hair, his hands gripping your waist in a heat of passion. It just&hellip; it looks so
                            real. And if it wasn&rsquo;t real, why wouldn&rsquo;t you tell me? If it was just for publicity why wouldn&rsquo;t-
                        </p>
                        <p>I hear our knock on the door. I wipe tears away from my eyes, trying to compose myself. I wonder what bullshit
                            you&rsquo;re going to come up with this time.</p>
                        <p>I open the door, and you&rsquo;re&hellip; so fake. You&rsquo;re smiling at me with your perfectly straight teeth,
                            your eyes look like plastic, your hair is <em>too</em> perfect, and I hate it.</p>
                        <p>You drop your purse and wrap me in a hug, and all I can smell is <em>him</em>.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; you mumble into my hair.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Liar. Liar, liar, liar.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; I ask, trying to keep my voice from shaking.</p>
                        <p>You pull away from me. &ldquo;Ah&hellip; Well, my manager wanted to get some more publicity for my movie
                            and&hellip;&rdquo; You take a deep breath. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad, but&hellip; they made me go on this fake
                            &lsquo;vacation&rsquo; with Steve to get more views on our show.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;How could you just&hellip; jet off to Hawaii with your &lsquo;fake&rsquo; boyfriend without telling your
                            &lsquo;real&rsquo; girlfriend?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Lucy, it&rsquo;s not like that,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;It was just for publicity.&rdquo; You take a step
                            closer.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Your viewership is already at two million. What more do you want?&rdquo; I move back, bumping into the
                            wall.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s my manager,&rdquo; you say, your voice dipping into hysteria.</p>
                        <p>I widen my stance, leaning on the wall for support. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen if we were in a
                            public relationship? Am I really that awful?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Luce, no, you&rsquo;re perfect, I-&rdquo; you keep fidgeting with your hands.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Then <em>why</em> can&rsquo;t we be together? Why do I have to see you every other day with Steve, when you
                            lock me up like a secret? Would it have been any different if I was a boy?&rdquo; I burst into messy, uncontrollable
                            tears, my hands wiping away the mascara running down my face.</p>
                        <p>You take a step towards me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re secret because they&rsquo;d <em>ruin</em> us, Lucy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;No, Ava. They&rsquo;d ruin your <em>career</em>. Not us.&rdquo; I sniff away my last few tears.</p>
                        <p>Your hands are trembling. &ldquo;I love you Lucy.&rdquo; You look up at me, hopeless. You&rsquo;re making a face
                            I&rsquo;m not used to seeing.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;But not more than you love your job,&rdquo; I say sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to be your priority, am
                            I?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Your eyes flit between your feet and me. &ldquo;I- Lucy, how can you-&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The hesitation is the nail in the coffin. I turn away, storming off to my room.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Lucy, wait&hellip;&rdquo; You reach for me, trying to infect me with your Midas touch. I jerk my hand away.
                            I&rsquo;m not falling for it this time.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I swallow back my tears, saving them for the lonely ride home.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just talk about this, like grown-ups?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen you in such a mess, your perfect golden curls out of place, your face
                            streaked with tears, but your eyes won&rsquo;t meet mine.</p>
                        <p>I turn away, not about to get sucked into your blinding light.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done talking.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Without another word, I grab my shit and leave as you give an Oscar-worthy tear-jerking performance.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I can&rsquo;t believe I thought you ever made me golden.</p>
