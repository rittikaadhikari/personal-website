                        <p>The rain thrums outside in an imperfect synergy, the droplets competing with one another to make themselves heard.
                            The greyish clouds blanket the sky, only parting for the occasional clap of thunder which almost aligns with the
                            vibrant streak of lightning that illuminates the world. I suppose it mirrors how my brother, the almighty Lord Zeus,
                            is feeling. The Olympian is likely not used to the sting of rejection; he had already wed thrice and fathered a slew
                            of children. Obviously, to any sane being, it&rsquo;s understandable <em>why </em>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to marry
                            such a man. After all, I am the goddess of marriage, and it would frankly be embarrassing if I had an unstable
                            relationship. (And I&rsquo;ll admit, I do have this lingering fear that I&rsquo;ll end up like Metis&hellip; I just
                            escaped the stomach of my father, so the possibility of being consumed by my brother isn&rsquo;t all that exciting.)
                            However, Zeus can&rsquo;t grasp that I&rsquo;m just not interested. Women normally fall at his feet (or he compels
                            them in one way or another), and I guess he expects nothing less from me.</p>
                        <p>He claims he&rsquo;s in love with me, that I linger in his every thought. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s fed every
                            woman around those empty lies. The thunder boomed again, as if in protest of my innermost thoughts. Zeus has thrown
                            Greece into a full-blown monsoon after my refusals, and Demeter keeps chewing me out for destroying her precious
                            farmlands. I miss when Helios scattered the sun&rsquo;s brilliance all over Mount Olympus, streaking the skies a
                            deep golden in the mornings. Now, he&rsquo;s just shrouded by Zeus&rsquo; tumultuous emotions.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Perhaps enough is enough, and I should at least consider his proposition. It&rsquo;s not as if he&rsquo;s physically
                            unappealing. Quite the opposite, in fact. He has this arrogant grace about him, with his sharp nose held high, and
                            ebony locks that fall onto his broad shoulders. His eyes are a glacial blue, with specks of dark grey swirling
                            around in a manner as turbulent as one of his storms.</p>
                        <p><em>Koo-kooo. Koo-kooo.</em></p>
                        <p>An attractive cuckoo is perched upon my windowsill, ruffling his dusky feathers every now and then from the
                            downpour.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><em>Koo-kooo! Koo-kooo!&nbsp;</em></p>
                        <p>His chirps are now a repeated refrain, appearing in short bursts as he alternates between crying and shuddering from
                            the cold.</p>
                        <p><em>Koo-kooooo!</em></p>
                        <p>He lets out a final squall, this time imploring with his captivating eyes.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I let him in, because what choice do I have? I can&rsquo;t ignore an animal in need - the motherly instinct in me
                            would never allow it. The cuckoo lets out a satisfied coo and snuggles by my hand. I gently pat him down with my
                            handkerchief and press him to my bosom for warmth. For a moment, he is silent and I swear, he stares right at me
                            with his piercing blue eyes. Do cuckoos even have blue eyes?</p>
                        <p>Before I can even think more on this matter, the cuckoo begins to squawk violently. He stumbles onto the armrest of
                            my chair and sputters out tufts of feathers. His breast puffs in and out, almost as if he is gasping for breath and
                            immediately I regret not bringing him sooner. A blinding light veils the cuckoo and more feathers splay in every
                            which way. The harsh thrum of the downpour eases into a light purring drizzle as the cuckoo is replaced by none
                            other than the Lord of the Gods.</p>
                        <p>He quickly places a hand over my mouth, probably sensing that I was about to let out some profanities.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I know you think I&rsquo;m crazy-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Crazy is an understatement here.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;-but, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>There it is.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I love you Hera. You&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re strong, you&rsquo;re beautiful, you&rsquo;re nurturing.
                            Please, be my queen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve never seen Lord Zeus look so flustered. He&rsquo;s completely out of sorts, his ebony locks all unruly
                            with feathers in every other direction, his normally ice-cold hands warm, maybe even sweaty, against my face, and
                            his words losing their regality and sinking into desperation. Well, he had to be desperate to turn into a
                            <em>bird</em> to &ldquo;seduce&rdquo; me. He shakily removes his hand, his calloused thumb lightly grazing my lips.
                            Strangely, my cheeks feel flushed.</p>
                        <p><em>Crack. Crack. Crack. Crack. Crack.</em></p>
                        <p>The thunder booms like a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>His eyes pierce mine, searching so hopelessly for an answer.</p>
                        <p>I shake off the heat rising to my forehead. A little vulnerability shouldn&rsquo;t throw me off.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Look Zeus, you just <em>think</em> you love me because I&rsquo;ve rebuffed you one too many times. I&rsquo;m a
                            challenge to you, not a wife.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t just be my wife - you would be my <em>queen</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>There he goes again. Zeus has always had a flair for the dramatic.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been married to <em>three</em> other women. I don&rsquo;t want our marriage to be a
                            mockery.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t! I would never - and I mean <em>never</em> - disrespect you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He brushes a strand of hair out of my face and stares earnestly back at me.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I am the goddess of <em>marriage</em>. You can&rsquo;t continue being this&hellip; this womanizer if
                            you&rsquo;re with me. Thou shalt not make a fool out of me.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I promise. I don&rsquo;t even need to look at another woman if you&rsquo;re my queen.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Zeus steps closer and gently places his hand on my cheek, rubbing away an escaped tear. I glance up at him, and
                            Fates, was that a mistake. My breath hitches as he leans in and kisses me, at first tentative then, assuredly. I
                            clutch at his mane of hair, my face flushing and my heart thumping in sync with the rain. He slowly pulls away and
                            holds my hands. I&rsquo;m not sure whether my hands are sweaty, or if it&rsquo;s his. His eyes are resolute as the
                            storm abates.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I nod and whisper, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>The weather is quite beautiful today in the Garden of Hesperides. The sky is a light sapphire blue sprinkled with
                            light feathery clouds. Helios made sure that the sun&rsquo;s radiance shone through the columns, upon which the
                            bright white trumpet flowers delicately coiled around. All of the Olympians and a few Titans are decked out in their
                            best togas. A few hummingbirds are singing a joyful hymn, flitting around from column to column. Demeter tenderly
                            places a delicate golden circlet with a sheer veil upon my head. All of the animals from the mountain are sitting
                            right at the entrance of the temple, watching the wedding. Zeus approaches, looking regal as ever with his curly
                            hair tamed and his confident smile. But I can tell he&rsquo;s nervous because his left hand is slightly quivering
                            and the clouds seem to drift together and apart, over and over.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The men and women sit at separate tables as we each feast on saccharine nectar. Zeus keeps sneaking glances over at
                            me, maybe trying to remember what I look like without the veil on. Perhaps the veil keeps the mystery alive. After
                            the feast, the gods and goddesses all present us with gifts - but Gaea gives us the best one of all. She plants an
                            enchanted tree which grows the most exquisite golden apples. I tell my grandmother that I am grateful, that we will
                            protect her gift. I can tell that Zeus cannot wait any longer because his tempestuous eyes keep trying to meet my
                            masked ones.</p>
                        <p>We step into a chariot to head back to his - no, our - palace. The pathway is lit with torches and paintings of the
                            two of us. As we step in, he slowly removes the veil from my face. He leans in to kiss me, this time, confident as
                            his hands embrace my hair. I feel myself flushing, and everything is red. It smells like roses and burning embers.
                            It feels like the slow kindling of a fire that you don&rsquo;t quite want to go out. I am in flames when I am with
                            him.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly when it all went wrong. We have three beautiful children (though Zeus will argue that only
                            <em>two</em> of them are beautiful - I&rsquo;ll admit that Hephaestus is a little rough around the edges, but his
                            intellect more than makes up for it), and an ornate palace. All of the Olympians used to respect our union - we were
                            the power couple of Mount Olympus for about three centuries. It&rsquo;s strange, because I thought our fire was
                            immortal, inextinguishable like Hestia&rsquo;s hearth. It is foolish of me to love a man like Zeus, and it is
                            pathetic how I continue to feed this tiny flame.</p>
                        <p>Zeus now swaggers into every room with that unwavering confidence. There&rsquo;s not even a single trace of that
                            nervousness from before. He is not as vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;My Queen!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He throws his hands up and has this devilish smirk on his face. His dark black curls lie perfectly on his shoulders,
                            and he holds his head high.</p>
                        <p>I roll my eyes.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I suppose Zeus may have tired of me after those three centuries of matrimony. But at least he hasn&rsquo;t broken his
                            promise.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I come and greet my beautiful wife?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He sounds&hellip; insincere. He embraces my shoulders and lightly kisses my neck. I flush lightly, giddy like a
                            schoolgirl. It&rsquo;s crazy how he can send me into such a frenzy with so little.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Of course you can.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>I grasp his hands and intertwine our fingers. They&rsquo;re so cold.</p>
                        <p>I keep searching his eyes, scanning to see beyond his icy exterior. I long to be let in once again, to comfort him in
                            the nights when he relives the war and his patricide, and to truly be his partner.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Queen Hera! How are you so perfect?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>That&rsquo;s a double-edged sword if I&rsquo;ve ever heard one.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I just feel this chasm between us, like we&rsquo;re on the opposite ends of Tartarus and I&rsquo;m the only one
                            reaching.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Knock it off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He throws his hands up in surrender, grinning cheekily, and plops down next to me. I gently move a lock of hair away
                            from his face and I see him stiffen.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What happened to us?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t like this before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He feigns indifference.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I love you just the same. I&rsquo;d still turn into a pigeon for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Zeus playfully touches my nose, as if to appease me, to tell me my worries were insignificant.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;A pigeon?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He lets out a boisterous laugh. &ldquo;Yes, a pigeon! Don&rsquo;t you remember how I proposed?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>My heart feels like it will leap right out of my chest, and I feel myself breaking into a cold sweat.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Do I what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Do you even remember how you proposed?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Of course I-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It was a cuckoo.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You turned into a cuckoo.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t under-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You said it was because you were &lsquo;cuckoo&rsquo; for me, or was that all a lie?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Hera, it&rsquo;s been three centuries. The details can get a little fuzzy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He wipes an angry tear from my face.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being ridiculous, sweetheart. Does it really matter if I remember what kind of bird I turned into
                            to propose?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Yes, yes it does. Because <em>I</em> remember.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Hera, you&rsquo;re my Queen. No one can replace you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>And yet you replaced your other three wives without a care.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>As if to demonstrate the veracity of his statement, a loud clap of thunder accompanies a sudden steady downpour.</p>
                        <p>His eyes are impenetrable, unreadable.</p>
                        <p>He leans in and kisses me, trying to mimic the passion he once had.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>And I fall for his show, again and again and again&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m supposed to be the perfect wife with the perfect family. I&rsquo;m supposed to love all of my children,
                            nurture them until adulthood, and guide them through life. But more importantly, it is my duty to cater to every
                            whim of my husband, to ensure that we have a happy union. Zeus and I are meant to be a precedent for all marriages.
                            He must love me, and I must love him, and we must live happily ever after for the rest of eternity.</p>
                        <p>So tell me, why am I alone in my bed every night?</p>
                        <p>If I am meant to be a paragon of matrimony, why does he leave at 2 AM every night when he thinks I am asleep?&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>He must think he is so clever.</p>
                        <p>He eases the weather into a slight drizzle, just enough to block out his footsteps (or so he thinks). Zeus thinks I
                            cannot hear the slight creak of the door or feel the light draft of wind creeping into our bedroom. He somehow even
                            believes that I wouldn&rsquo;t feel his lingering warmth disappear, the imprint of his body fade away, as if the
                            rain could cloak his nightly excursions.</p>
                        <p>The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Today, I finally gather the courage to see what my husband is up to. The first day, I pretended he left because he
                            couldn&rsquo;t sleep and did not want to wake me. The fourth day, I deluded myself into believing one of his
                            brothers called, and that he had urgent business to attend to as part of the Big Three. By the fifteenth day, I ran
                            out of excuses and just cried myself to sleep. But today, on the eighteenth day, I muster the strength to learn
                            where Zeus sneaks off to.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I wait a minute after hearing the familiar creak and close of the door, before tip toeing behind my husband, careful
                            not to be seen. He is strutting, his chest out and his arms swinging; wherever Zeus is going, he is confident he
                            will not be discovered. He turns into the Foloi oak forest and walks into a dimly lit cabin. I cannot enter without
                            making myself known, so I duck into a shrub by a window. I can just barely make out a hushed conversation.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; Zeus says tenderly.</p>
                        <p>I haven&rsquo;t heard him use that tone in decades.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I missed you more.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A soft, husky voice responds.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s like my entire body is frozen. Silent tears stream down my face. He broke his promise. I know he
                            doesn&rsquo;t love me anymore; I would have to be blind. Fuck if he doesn&rsquo;t love me, but he doesn&rsquo;t even
                            respect me. Besides, <em>he&rsquo;s</em> the one that begged to marry me. Not the other way around. So why am
                            <em>I</em> the one who&rsquo;s hurting?</p>
                        <p>I clutch the windowsill and stagger back up to peer through. I must know where I am lacking. She has long auburn hair
                            and sincere hazel eyes. But even worse she-</p>
                        <p>I-&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>She&rsquo;s <em>pregnant</em>.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Zeus is cupping her baby belly and smiling at her, the way he did whenever I was with child. They look like what a
                            marriage should look like and she seems like she&rsquo;ll be the <em>perfect</em> mother.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I think I would have preferred it if Zeus had swallowed me whole.</p>
                        <p>I would have preferred if the Titanomachy had never happened, if Zeus had never been King of the Gods, if he had not
                            pursued me with such a vivacity only to drop me like an old toga.</p>
                        <p>He told me I was irreplaceable.</p>
                        <p>Gasping, silently choking away the sobs, I flee from the forest, back to what we call <em>our</em> home, even though
                            everything has been ruined.</p>
                        <p>He has ruined me.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>But even more so, <em>she</em> has ruined everything.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I could have lived with being unloved, though perhaps I longed for more. But I cannot stand silently and be
                            cuckqueaned. I am the goddess of marriage, and I will see to it that <em>my</em> marriage does not break.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>Zeus returns to our bed at 5 in the morning. I don&rsquo;t even want to think about what he was doing with that
                            whore. My eyes are red and puffy, but again, he does not love me so he will not notice. When we &ldquo;wake&rdquo;,
                            he pretends that I am the love of his life. I don&rsquo;t know where he got his way with words. He should have been
                            the god of insincerity.</p>
                        <p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to say it. He must know I will find out soon. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before
                            she&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Your mistress is pregnant,&rdquo; I blurt absentmindedly.</p>
                        <p>Zeus, for the first time in a while, lets down his icy exterior.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I- I know she&rsquo;s pregnant.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;W-what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>He&rsquo;s trying so hard to keep his cool, but I guess he didn&rsquo;t expect me to find out myself.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Leto. Your mistress. She&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>I let out a long sigh.</p>
                        <p>He glances up at me and nods.</p>
                        <p>I fight back tears.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>He does not answer. Maybe he doesn't even have an answer. Or maybe he just doesn&rsquo;t want to hurt me.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I gave you <em>everything</em>, Zeus! I was perfectly happy without you, and you&hellip; you came along,
                            acting like I would always be <em>your everything</em> and that we would be happy and that you would
                            <em>change</em>. But you know what Zeus? You&rsquo;re exactly the same as you always were.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Again, he does not have a response.</p>
                        <p>The floodgates have opened, and there&rsquo;s no stopping them.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What did I do wrong? Why don&rsquo;t you love me?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Hera, I-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t give me that bullshit, telling me that you love me. You haven&rsquo;t loved me like that for
                            the last three decades.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Zeus is flushed, but this time, not from desperation. No, this time, he is embarrassed. For once, his big, stupid,
                            overly confident mouth has nothing to say. The skies have turned silvery, the clouds feathering together.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not make a fool out of me. Leto will pay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He jumps up, concerned for that dumb mistress of his.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;What do you <em>mean</em> she&rsquo;ll &lsquo;pay&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean she will suffer for destroying our marriage.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Hera, she didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go fuck someone else, Zeus. That&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re good at.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>His eyes flash dangerously, and for a second, I fear a repeat of my childhood, where I was trapped in that cramped
                            dark little space. A thunderstorm has begun, the claps of thunder continually increasing in intensity.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I- I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>I stumble back onto our bed.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Zeus takes a deep breath, and the storm seems to quiet.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be Zeus&rsquo; fault.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;She must have seduced you, and I must punish her for this as the goddess of marriage.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It is not your fault.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Oh, yes you very much can. And you will, but I suppose you feel bad, so you&rsquo;ll let me inconvenience her.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>I curtsy, and he strides out of our room. I fall onto the floor uncontrollably sobbing. Where is the man I married?
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                        <p>I punished Leto, and every other bitch my philanderer of a husband that dared (and will dare) to touch. That&rsquo;s
                            the only way I can protect my marriage and my dignity. Even if all that&rsquo;s left is a loveless marriage, I know
                            that I must defend our union. I sometimes long for the days when we were ridiculously in love. I&rsquo;m sure Zeus
                            misses that feeling too, or he wouldn&rsquo;t let me fight so hard to keep our tiny spark alive for the rest of
                            eternity.</p>
                        <p>Every spring, there&rsquo;s this one month of vulnerability we have with one another. It&rsquo;s monsoon season, and
                            it somehow sparks that long forgotten passion. His eyes look like the storm, and I decide to trust him, for that
                            fleeting time. I trust that his eyes only ever look like that when he looks at me, that he saves this moment of
                            weakness just for me. And he recognizes me as his partner, his unwavering wife who he divulges his demons to. In the
                            monsoon, we are ablaze in ribbons of oranges and reds, tangling together and apart in a tantric dance. And without,
                            we are the archetype of a jealous wife and playboy husband.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it is not the perfect marriage I had dreamt of, and it likely never will be. But it would never have been
                            enough for us to be warm by a hearth we tamed together; we were always meant to be twin flames, gently stinging at
                            each other, until we burst together into one fiery messy frenzy.</p>
